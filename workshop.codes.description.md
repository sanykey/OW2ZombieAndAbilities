Zombie team bots calculate target priority based on distance to the target plus modifiers. Normally, bots select the nearest target.
Being behind a wall or invisible reduces priority.
Having the tank class increases priority.

# Common zombie bots:
To keep the start of the game manageable, only 6 zombie bots will attack simultaneously in the first 5 rounds. From round 6 onward, there will be 14 zombie bots

[hero Torbjörn] Just swings a hammer. Occasionally gets angry and spills hot beer right at your feet. In rounds 45–50 and in random rounds after 55, Torbjörn zombies spawn with fully charged ultimates.
[hero Junkrat] During pursuit, they scatter Steel Traps. Appear in rounds 25–29 and in random rounds after 55.
[hero Symmetra] They deploy Sentry Turrets everywhere. Appear in rounds 35–39 and in random rounds after 55.
Warning: A large number of Sentry Turrets significantly strains the server.

# Elite zombie bots:
[hero Mauga] Appears in round 5. Uses Overrun on players and ignites those hit. The burn lasts a long time but can be removed with a health pack.
[hero Widowmaker] Appears in round 7. Stationary. Teleports between sniper positions.
[hero Roadhog] Appears in round 10. Pulls enemies toward herself. Melee attacks may apply the Hacked effect to victims.
